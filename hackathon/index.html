            <h4>Origin</h4>
            <p>
              Brewing is the production of beer by steeping a starch source
              (commonly cereal grains, the most popular of which is barley) in
              water and fermenting the resulting sweet liquid with yeast. It may
              be done in a brewery by a commercial brewer, at home by a
              homebrewer, or communally. Brewing has taken place since around
              the 6th millennium BC, and archaeological evidence suggests that
              emerging civilizations, including ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia,
              brewed beer. Since the nineteenth century the brewing industry has
              been part of most western economies. The basic ingredients of beer
              are water and a fermentable starch source such as malted barley.
              Most beer is fermented with a brewer's yeast and flavoured with
              hops. Less widely used starch sources include millet, sorghum and
              cassava. Secondary sources (adjuncts), such as maize (corn), rice,
              or sugar, may also be used, sometimes to reduce cost, or to add a
              feature, such as adding wheat to aid in retaining the foamy head
              of the beer. The most common starch source is ground cereal or
              "grist" - the proportion of the starch or cereal ingredients in a
              beer recipe may be called grist, grain bill, or simply mash
              ingredients.

              Steps in the brewing process include malting, milling, mashing,
              lautering, boiling, fermenting, conditioning, filtering, and
              packaging. There are three main fermentation methods, warm, cool
              and spontaneous. Fermentation may take place in an open or closed
              fermenting vessel; a secondary fermentation may also occur in the
              cask or bottle. There are several additional brewing methods, such
              as Burtonisation, double dropping, and Yorkshire Square, as well
              as post-fermentation treatment such as filtering, and
              barrel-ageing.

            <h4>Brewing process</h4>
            <p>
              There are several steps in the brewing process, which may include
              malting, mashing, lautering, boiling, fermenting, conditioning,
              filtering, and packaging. The brewing equipment needed to make
              beer has grown more sophisticated over time, and now covers most
              aspects of the brewing process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Malting is the process where barley grain is made ready for
              brewing. Malting is broken down into three steps in order to help
              to release the starches in the barley. First, during steeping, the
              grain is added to a vat with water and allowed to soak for
              approximately 40 hours. During germination, the grain is spread
              out on the floor of the germination room for around 5 days. The
              final part of malting is kilning when the malt goes through a very
              high temperature drying in a kiln; with gradual temperature
              increase over several hours. When kilning is complete, the grains
              are now termed malt, and they will be milled or crushed to break
              apart the kernels and expose the cotyledon, which contains the
              majority of the carbohydrates and sugars; this makes it easier to
              extract the sugars during mashing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mashing converts the starches released during the malting stage
              into sugars that can be fermented. The milled grain is mixed with
              hot water in a large vessel known as a mash tun. In this vessel,
              the grain and water are mixed together to create a cereal mash.
              During the mash, naturally occurring enzymes present in the malt
              convert the starches (long chain carbohydrates) in the grain into
              smaller molecules or simple sugars (mono-, di-, and
              tri-saccharides). This "conversion" is called saccharification
              which occurs between the temperatures 60–70 °C (140–158 °F). The
              result of the mashing process is a sugar-rich liquid or "wort",
              which is then strained through the bottom of the mash tun in a
              process known as lautering. Prior to lautering, the mash
              temperature may be raised to about 75–78 °C (167–172 °F) (known as
              a mashout) to free up more starch and reduce mash viscosity.
              Additional water may be sprinkled on the grains to extract
              additional sugars (a process known as sparging).
            </p>
            <p>
              The wort is moved into a large tank known as a "copper" or kettle
              where it is boiled with hops and sometimes other ingredients such
              as herbs or sugars. This stage is where many chemical reactions
              take place, and where important decisions about the flavor, color,
              and aroma of the beer are made. The boiling process serves to
              terminate enzymatic processes, precipitate proteins, isomerize hop
              resins, and concentrate and sterilize the wort. Hops add flavor,
              aroma and bitterness to the beer. At the end of the boil, the
              hopped wort settles to clarify in a vessel called a "whirlpool",
              where the more solid particles in the wort are separated out.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the whirlpool, the wort is drawn away from the compacted hop
              trub, and rapidly cooled via a heat exchanger to a temperature
              where yeast can be added. A variety of heat exchanger designs are
              used in breweries, with the most common a plate-style. Water or
              glycol run in channels in the opposite direction of the wort,
              causing a rapid drop in temperature. It is very important to
              quickly cool the wort to a level where yeast can be added safely
              as yeast is unable to grow in very high temperatures and will
              start to die in temperatures above 60 °C (140 °F). After the wort
              goes through the heat exchanger, the cooled wort goes into a
              fermentation tank. A type of yeast is selected and added, or
              "pitched", to the fermentation tank. When the yeast is added to
              the wort, the fermenting process begins, where the sugars turn
              into alcohol, carbon dioxide and other components. When the
              fermentation is complete the brewer may rack the beer into a new
              tank, called a conditioning tank. Conditioning of the beer is the
              process in which the beer ages, the flavor becomes smoother, and
              flavors that are unwanted dissipate. After conditioning for a week
              to several months, the beer may be filtered, and force carbonated
              for bottling or fined in the cask.
